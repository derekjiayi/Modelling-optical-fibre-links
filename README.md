# Modelling-optical-fibre-links
This model provides the functions of genarating eye diargams of all 3-bit signals and calculating the SNR and BER in a optical fibre link.
The output of the ass3b_L.m program is the eye diagrams of 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps at different distances of the fibre.
The ass1_1.m generates the dispersion of the Gaussian pulse at 10, 50, and 100 km.
